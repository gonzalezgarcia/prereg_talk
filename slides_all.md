"When not planned beforehand, data analysis can approximate a projective technique, such as the Rorschach, because ==the investigator can project on the data== his own expectancies, desires, or biases and can pull out of the data almost any ‚Äúfinding‚Äù he may desire."
<br></br>

‚Äî Theodore X. Barber (1976)

## A document that:
<v-clicks>

- specifies research design and analysis plan ==before== the project starts
- is uploaded on dedicated ==repositories== (e.g., OSF)
- is made ==public==, either immediately or after an embargo period

# What is Preregistration?
<v-clicks>

- Preregistration involves documenting your research plan before you begin data collection.
  - A **time-stamped** research design, hypothesis, and analysis plan, usually registered with an independent body (e.g., OSF).

</v-clicks>

<v-clicks>

- Elements typically included:
  - **Hypothesis**
  - **Data collection methods**
  - **Sample size rationale**
  - **Statistical analysis plan**

</v-clicks>

<v-clicks>

- **Purpose**: To prevent questionable research practices and distinguish between confirmatory and exploratory research.

</v-clicks>

<v-clicks>

But ==**why**==?

# The Replication Crisis in Psychology

- Psychology and related fields are experiencing a "crisis of credibility."
- A few high-profile cases of data fabrication, but the larger problem lies in systemic issues like:
  - Underpowered studies
  - P-hacking (analyzing data until desired results are achieved)
  - HARKing (Hypothesizing After the Results are Known)
- As a result, many studies fail to replicate, leading to skepticism about their findings.
- The **Reproducibility Project** in 2015 highlighted that many psychological studies failed to replicate successfully.


<!-- slide 9 -->
---
layout: default
---

# The Replication Crisis and Preregistration as a Solution

- **Replication Crisis**: Strong bias toward positive results, flexibility in data analysis, and lack of transparency contribute to irreproducible findings.
  - 97% of original studies showed significant findings, whereas only 37% of replications did (Reproducibility Project).
- **Solution**: Preregistration combats this by:
  - Clearly separating confirmatory from exploratory research.
  - Reducing researcher bias by setting plans **before** data collection.
  - Making research **more transparent** and **reproducible**.

# The garden of forking paths

:: left ::


<v-clicks>

- **Concept**: Flexibility in data analysis leads to numerous paths researchers could take, often resulting in statistically significant findings.
- **Gelman and Loken (2013)**: This concept illustrates how different decisions in analysis can inflate false-positive results.
  - Example: Decisions such as whether to exclude outliers, what measures to use, etc., can all alter outcomes.
- **Preregistration** helps predefine these choices, limiting flexibility and preventing P-hacking.

# The benefits of preregistration

<v-clicks>

- **Reduces Bias**: Preregistration helps reduce bias toward statistically significant findings and encourages reporting of all results, not just positive ones.
- **Transparency**: Improves transparency by making it clear what was planned versus what was discovered post-hoc.
- **Publication Bias**: Minimizes selective reporting by making all study plans accessible, regardless of outcomes.
- **Prevents HARKing**: Clearly distinguishes between **hypothesis-generating** (exploratory) and **hypothesis-testing** (confirmatory) analyses.

## Common elements of preregistrations

A good preregistration typically includes:
  - **Hypotheses**: Clearly defined research questions.
  - **Design Plan**: Details about study design, blinding, and randomization.
  - **Sampling Plan**: Sample size, data collection methods, stopping rules.
  - **Variables**: Manipulated and measured variables.
  - **Analysis Plan**: Planned statistical models and criteria for inference.
- Various templates can be used, such as those offered by **OSF** or **AsPredicted**.

## Platforms for preregistrations

There are several platforms available for preregistration, including institutional repositories such as **ClinicalTrials.gov** or **AEA Registry** for specific fields. 

In Psychology and Cognitive Neuroscience, the two most widely used platforms are [**Open Science Framework (OSF)**](https://help.osf.io/article/158-create-a-preregistration) and [**AsPredicted**](https://aspredicted.org/create.php). They offer similar features, but you might prefer one over the other based on your needs.

| Feature | OSF | AsPredicted |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Templates** | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ |
| **Embargo Periods** | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ (but less flexibility) |
| **Ease of Use** | ü•à | ü•á |
| **Amount of info required** | quite a lot | less |

## Preregistration in Practice

## Example Workflow


1. **Create Preregistration**: Develop and register your hypothesis, design, and analysis plan.
2. **Data Collection**: Conduct data collection according to the preregistered plan.
3. **Data Analysis**:
   - Confirmatory analyses: Follow the preregistered analysis plan.
   - Exploratory analyses: Clearly distinguish from confirmatory ones.
4. **Report Results**: Publish with a clear distinction between confirmatory and exploratory findings.


<!-- slide 16 -->
---
layout: default
---

## Goind beyond preregistrations: Registered Reports

- **What are Registered Reports?**
  - A **publication model** where the study design and analysis plan are peer-reviewed before data collection.
  - If approved, the paper is guaranteed publication regardless of the study's findings.
- **Advantages**:
  - Reduces **publication bias**.
  - Moves emphasis from study results to the quality of the research methodology.
  - Ensures transparency and rigor throughout the study process.

<!-- slide 17 -->

## Incentives for preregistering and RR

- **Badges and Awards**:
  - Journals offer **Preregistration Badges** to signal that a study was preregistered.
  - **Center for Open Science** offers financial incentives through the Preregistration Challenge.
- **Career Benefits**:
  - Signals a rigorous approach to reviewers and collaborators.
  - Improves credibility and reproducibility of published work.

# How to install


The theme depends on Slidev.  So you need to have that [installed first](https://sli.dev/guide/install).  Then you can install the theme with npm:

```bash
npm install slidev-theme-neversink
```

Then create a slidev markdown file (e.g., `slides.md`) and add the theme to the frontmatter of your first slide:

```md
---
theme: neversink
---
```


---
layout: default
---

# Color schemes

In many parts of the theme you can use the color schemes to help choose matching colors for your slides.  For example, we can make a slide with a sticky note using the `rose-light` color scheme, the `sky` color scheme, or the `amber-light` color scheme:

<StickyNote color="rose-light" textAlign="left" width="100px" v-drag="[122,253,180,180,-10]">

Hello, I'm a **redish sticky note** using `rose-light`.
</StickyNote>
<StickyNote color="green-light" textAlign="left" width="180px"  v-drag="[650,253,180,180,-9]">

Hello, I'm a **yellowish sticky note** using `amber-light`.
</StickyNote>


---
layout: side-title
color: emerald-light
align: rm-lm
titlewidth: is-2
---

<StickyNote color="emerald-light" textAlign="left" width="180px"  v-drag="[719,291,180,180,16]">

Don't worry if you don't understand all the details, yet we are still talking about **color schemes**.
</StickyNote>


:: title ::
# Color schemes

Or we can use the `emerald-light` scheme in a slide layout to set the overall color and style of a slide with a matching sticky note:

```md
---
layout: side-title
color: emerald-light
align: rm-lm
titlewidth: is-3
---
```

layout: top-title-two-cols

# Two things about layouts



:: left ::

There are two important parts of slides to know about.

## Frontmatter 

First is **frontmatter**, which are configuration options
that appear at the start of each slide (see [Slidev docs](https://sli.dev/guide/syntax#frontmatter-layouts)).  These configure things like
alignment, color, and spacing:

```md
---
layout: top-title
color: sky
align: l
---
```

:: right ::

# Slots 

The other aspect is **slots**.  Slots are a basic part of [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/guide/components/slots.html).  In Slidev slots can be marked using `:: slotname ::` and then filled in with content.  For example, the `:: left ::` and `:: right ::` slots on this slide are filled with content.

Slots effectively help you map parts of your slide to different parts of a layout.  The most common case is to say which content appears in the left column and which appears in the right column. But different layouts can have different slots and different content.

# This is the `cover` layout

_New York University_ <a href="https://todd.gureckislab.org" class="ns-c-iconlink"><mdi-open-in-new /></a>  

:: note ::

<div class="fw-100" >

\* Optional `:: note ::` slot for mentioning ==notes== at the bottom.

</div>

---
layout: default
---

# This is the `default` layout

This is kind of the basic slide.  The main content is interpreted as markdown and rendered in the center of the slide.  

Speaking of markdown, you can use markdown to make things **bold** or *italic* or even `code` like `this`.  In **Neversink** you can also ==highlight things using the double equals signs like this==
thanks to the `markdown-it-mark` plugin.

Of course you can make bullet lists:

- Hi
- There

Also there's a little helper class `ns-c-tight` you can add to make the bullet spacing a bit tighter:

<div class="ns-c-tight">

- Hi
- There
- I need space
</div>

---
layout: section
color: indigo
---

# The `section` layout
<hr>
It has a `hr` which is color matched to the color scheme.  For example, this slide is using the `navy` color scheme and the line is white.

---
layout: section
color: indigo
---

<div class="w-2/3 ml-30">

# The `section` layout
<hr>

<span class='text-amber-300'>
You can use HTML and inline CSS to modify the look and feel.
</span>


</div>

---
layout: quote
color: red-light
quotesize: text-xs
authorsize: text-2xs
author: "XX XXX"
---

"This is a quote slide.  It has a frontmatter option of `quote` which is the text that appears in the quote box and `author` and options for the size of the text(`quotesize: text-2xl` and `authorsize: text-l`).  I feel it is a little uninspired but might save you some time."

:: title ::

# `two-cols-title`

:: left ::

This is `layout: two-cols-title`. 

- There are three slots: `:: title ::`, `:: left ::`, and `:: right ::` along with the default which is implicit before any named slots.

- It additionally provides three configuration options in the slide YAML front matter:
  `color`, `columns` and `align`.

:: right ::

- `color` is the color scheme.

- `columns` is the relative spacing given to the left versus right column. The overall space is divided into 12 columns. Instructions like `is-5` will give 5 units to the left and 7 to the right.

- The <code>align</code> parameter determines how the columns look. The notation is for example
  <code>align: l-cm-cm</code>. The first part is for the header, the second for the left column, the third part is for the right column. The first letter is (<code>c</code> for center, <code>l</code> for left, <code>r</code> for right), the second letter
  is vertical alignment (<code>t</code> for top, <code>m</code> for middle, <code>b</code> for bottom). Only c/l/r works for the header.
