"When not planned beforehand, data analysis can approximate a projective technique, such as the Rorschach, because ==the investigator can project on the data== his own expectancies, desires, or biases and can pull out of the data almost any ‚Äúfinding‚Äù he may desire."
<br></br>

‚Äî Theodore X. Barber (1976)

"The first principle is that you must not fool yourself ‚Äì ==and you are the easiest person to fool‚Ä¶== After you‚Äôve not fooled yourself, it‚Äôs easy not to fool other scientists. You just have to be honest in a conventional way after that"

## A document that:
<v-clicks>

- specifies research design and analysis plan ==before== the project starts
- is uploaded on dedicated ==repositories== (e.g., OSF)
- is made ==public==, either immediately or after an embargo period

</v-clicks>

# What is Preregistration?
<v-clicks>

- Preregistration involves documenting your research plan before you begin data collection.
  - A **time-stamped** research design, hypothesis, and analysis plan, usually registered with an independent body (e.g., OSF).

</v-clicks>

<v-clicks>

- Elements typically included:
  - **Hypothesis**
  - **Data collection methods**
  - **Sample size rationale**
  - **Statistical analysis plan**

</v-clicks>

<v-clicks>

- **Purpose**: To prevent questionable research practices and distinguish between confirmatory and exploratory research.

</v-clicks>

# The Replication Crisis in Psychology

- Psychology and related fields are experiencing a "crisis of credibility."
- A few high-profile cases of data fabrication, but the larger problem lies in systemic issues like:
  - Underpowered studies
  - P-hacking (analyzing data until desired results are achieved)
  - HARKing (Hypothesizing After the Results are Known)
- As a result, many studies fail to replicate, leading to skepticism about their findings.
- The **Reproducibility Project** in 2015 highlighted that many psychological studies failed to replicate successfully.


<!-- slide 9 -->

# The Replication Crisis and Preregistration as a Solution

- **Replication Crisis**: Strong bias toward positive results, flexibility in data analysis, and lack of transparency contribute to irreproducible findings.
  - 97% of original studies showed significant findings, whereas only 37% of replications did (Reproducibility Project).
- **Solution**: Preregistration combats this by:
  - Clearly separating confirmatory from exploratory research.
  - Reducing researcher bias by setting plans **before** data collection.
  - Making research **more transparent** and **reproducible**.

<v-clicks>

- **Concept**: Flexibility in data analysis leads to numerous paths researchers could take, often resulting in statistically significant findings.
- **Gelman and Loken (2013)**: This concept illustrates how different decisions in analysis can inflate false-positive results.
  - Example: Decisions such as whether to exclude outliers, what measures to use, etc., can all alter outcomes.
- **Preregistration** helps predefine these choices, limiting flexibility and preventing P-hacking.

# The benefits of preregistration

<v-clicks>

- **Reduces Bias**: Preregistration helps reduce bias toward statistically significant findings and encourages reporting of all results, not just positive ones.
- **Transparency**: Improves transparency by making it clear what was planned versus what was discovered post-hoc.
- **Publication Bias**: Minimizes selective reporting by making all study plans accessible, regardless of outcomes.
- **Prevents HARKing**: Clearly distinguishes between **hypothesis-generating** (exploratory) and **hypothesis-testing** (confirmatory) analyses.

## Common elements of preregistrations

A good preregistration typically includes:
  - **Hypotheses**: Clearly defined research questions.
  - **Design Plan**: Details about study design, blinding, and randomization.
  - **Sampling Plan**: Sample size, data collection methods, stopping rules.
  - **Variables**: Manipulated and measured variables.
  - **Analysis Plan**: Planned statistical models and criteria for inference.
- Various templates can be used, such as those offered by **OSF** or **AsPredicted**.

**NOTEüí°**

In principle, **any** document that is time-stamped and made public can serve as a preregistration.

## Platforms for preregistrations

There are several platforms available for preregistration, including institutional repositories such as **ClinicalTrials.gov** or **AEA Registry** for specific fields. 

In Psychology and Cognitive Neuroscience, the two most widely used platforms are [**Open Science Framework (OSF)**](https://help.osf.io/article/158-create-a-preregistration) and [**AsPredicted**](https://aspredicted.org/create.php). They offer similar features, but you might prefer one over the other based on your needs.

| Feature | OSF | AsPredicted |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Templates** | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ |
| **Embargo Periods** | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ (but less flexibility) |
| **Ease of Use** | ü•à | ü•á |
| **Amount of info required** | quite a lot | less |

## Preregistration in Practice

## Example Workflow


1. **Create Preregistration**: Develop and register your hypothesis, design, and analysis plan.
2. **Data Collection**: Conduct data collection according to the preregistered plan.
3. **Data Analysis**:
   - Confirmatory analyses: Follow the preregistered analysis plan.
   - Exploratory analyses: Clearly distinguish from confirmatory ones.
4. **Report Results**: Publish with a clear distinction between confirmatory and exploratory findings.

## Goind beyond preregistrations: Registered Reports

- **What are Registered Reports?**
  - A **publication model** where the study design and analysis plan are peer-reviewed before data collection.
  - If approved, the paper is guaranteed publication regardless of the study's findings.
- **Advantages**:
  - Reduces **publication bias**.
  - Moves emphasis from study results to the quality of the research methodology.
  - Ensures transparency and rigor throughout the study process.

## Incentives for preregistering and RR

- **Badges and Awards**:
  - Journals offer **Preregistration Badges** to signal that a study was preregistered.
  - **Center for Open Science** offers financial incentives through the Preregistration Challenge.
- **Career Benefits**:
  - Signals a rigorous approach to reviewers and collaborators.
  - Improves credibility and reproducibility of published work.
